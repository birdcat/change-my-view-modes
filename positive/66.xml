Full disclosure I use an iPhone but any smart phone can handle this. 

  <claim>There isn't a single instance where a mobile website is preferable to a full site</claim>. <premise>The information is gutted and moved around</premise> <premise>making the site difficult to browse if it's something you are familiar with</premise> and <premise>less useful because the information is presented in a mobile-friendly way</premise>. I believe <premise>smart phones are prevalent enough among phone users who want to use the Internet</premise> that <claim>it outweighs the "some people don't have smartphones" argument</claim>. Change my view. 

Edit 1: I would like to change my position a little to be <claim>"Websites should not default force mobile and have the option to go default and instead start default and allow mobile."</claim>

Edit 2: Is it typical of change my view to downvote the ops responses across the thread because you disagree with their view? <claim>It's very off putting and doesn't encourage me, as op, to continue discussing my view</claim>.

As someone from a developing country, I would like to point out that <claim>mobile sites require less amount of data transfer to view than a desktop site<claim> <premise>which is a big thing for us due to slower Internet connections</premise>.
