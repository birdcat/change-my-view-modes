*Note: Please assume that there is no afterlife when responding to my post. I am not religious. Thank you. ALSO: By "meaningless," I mean "meaningless" to the person who is doing the dying. To the person who is alive and who will then die, life is meaningless. 

CMV. Assuming <premise>there is no afterlife</premise>, <claim>life is ultimately meaningless and pointless</claim> because <premise>we die</premise>. <claim>Death is the great eraser</claim>. <premise>Living life is as irrational as reading a book that, after finished, is immediately erased from your memory</premise>. <premise>It is comparable to that, too</premise>. 

  <claim>It makes no difference if I, a 23 year old, die now or live until I am 100 and die</claim>. <premise>Either way, after my brief spark of existence I become nothingness<.premise>. <premise>Not only do I remember nothing; I AM nothing</premise>. <premise>To me, it is as if my life had never happened</premise>. 

I'll put it another way. <premise>Imagine the time before you were born</premise>. Have you remembered it yet? <premise>Of course not</premise>. <premise>You didn't exist</premise>. <premise>This is the state that we return to after death--a state of nothingness similar to the state we were in before birth</premise>. <premise>When I die, I return to this state after a brief period of consciousness</premise>, and <premise>I return to it permanently</premise>. <premise>I might as well have never lived</premise>. 

To anticipate a few responses:

  (1) <claim>Helping others doesn't matter</claim>. <premise>They will die too</premise>. <premise>And then their descendants will die, on and on and on</premise>, until <premise>eventually the universe is destroyed or our galaxy collapses in an inevitable heat-death</premise>. <premise>Even if 1,000,000 people were helped by me</premise>, <premise>assuming they all die</premise>, then <claim>my life is still pointless and meaningless</claim>. For <premise>I will be dead and won't know what I did</premise>, and <premise>once they die, they won't know either</premise>. 

  (2) <claim>Attaining fame doesn't matter and doesn't truly make me "immortal."</claim> <premise>I'll be dead, and again, death is nothingness</premise>. Thus, <premise>I won't be around to enjoy my fame</premise>. 

  (3) <premise>Enjoying the moment is possible</premise>, but <claim>doesn't make life have a point</claim>. For <premise>once I die, all memories and all point is gone</premise>. 

Please change my view from this depressing sentiment.

<premise>Your point is predicated on the assumption that something is pointless if it doesn't last forever</premise>. <claim>I'm having a hard time understanding how you came to this conclusion</claim>.

<premise>Imagine reading a book that, once finished, is immediately erased from your memory</premise>. <premise>That is what life is like</premise>. <premise>Reading the book is ULTIMATELY pointless</premise>. <premise>Because it is erased from your memory</premise>.

  <claim>Life is pointless in a similar manner</claim>.

  <claim>I wouldn't consider it pointless if I derived pleasure from reading it at the time</claim>.

I mean if you really believe that everything that does not last forever is pointless, why do you do anything? Why not sit in a corner and stare at a wall until you die? <premise>I would guess that it's because you derive pleasure from certain things in life and that you pursue these things just like everyone else does</premise>.

My fear is that <premise>pursuing those things is irrational</premise>, that since <premise>death is coming and will erase all experience regardless</premise>, <claim>I might as well go ahead and die</claim>. 

Especially if there is more pain or dull moments than pleasure in life, why not just die?

Why is it irrational to pursue something pleasurable that will not provide pleasure of an infinite duration? <claim>That seems like an arbitrary condition to apply to the value of pursuing pleasurable things.</claim>
