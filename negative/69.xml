<title>CMV: EMTs, SAR, firefighters, police, etc. should receive “military discounts”.</title>

For those of you who don’t know, <premise>it’s common (at least in the US) for businesses, transit agencies, etc. to give small discounts to military veterans to thank them for their service</premise>.

<claim>It seems that medical responders (even hospital staff, actually) and other emergency services do more good for society than soldiers</claim> and that <claim>such discounts should be given to them</claim>.

<premise>As for the “They’re not risking their lives for our country.” argument, police officers do that too, and for citizens rather than the country and its interests</premise>. <premise>Some might argue that soldiers do the US a disservice rather than help</premise>, but <premise>that’s [usually] the fault of their leaders and therefore not relevant to the debate</premise>.

I’m really hoping there’s a good reason behind the status quo, but we’ll see. <premise>[It looks like there’s even less reason behind it than I initially thought, actually.]</premise>

[[My view’s been changed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rexe3/cmv_emts_sar_firefighters_police_etc_should/cnfj9cu?context=10000) In summary, I think that <claim>EMS people are just as deserving of these discounts (and that many more people contribute enough to be placed in the same category)</claim>, but I now believe - for the same reason - that <claim>these discounts shouldn’t be offered at all</claim>.]

&gt; <claim>Sure firefighters, EMT's, and nurses do great things for people. . . for those who have money and great insurance.</claim>

<claim>It’s not like the dispatcher chooses which calls to answer based on insurance policies.</claim>

&gt;What a douchebag line.

You’ll have fun [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rexe3/cmv_emts_sar_firefighters_police_etc_should/cnf9wqo?context=3), then.
