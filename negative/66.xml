*Note: Please assume that there is no afterlife when responding to my post. I am not religious. Thank you. ALSO: By "meaningless," I mean "meaningless" to the person who is doing the dying. To the person who is alive and who will then die, life is meaningless. 

CMV. Assuming <premise>there is no afterlife</premise>, <claim>life is ultimately meaningless and pointless</claim> because <premise>we die</premise>. <claim>Death is the great eraser</claim>. <premise>Living life is as irrational as reading a book that, after finished, is immediately erased from your memory</premise>. <premise>It is comparable to that, too</premise>. 

  <claim>It makes no difference if I, a 23 year old, die now or live until I am 100 and die</claim>. <premise>Either way, after my brief spark of existence I become nothingness</premise>. <premise>Not only do I remember nothing; I AM nothing</premise>. <premise>To me, it is as if my life had never happened</premise>. 

I'll put it another way. <premise>Imagine the time before you were born</premise>. Have you remembered it yet? <premise>Of course not</premise>. <premise>You didn't exist</premise>. <premise>This is the state that we return to after death--a state of nothingness similar to the state we were in before birth</premise>. <premise>When I die, I return to this state after a brief period of consciousness</premise>, and <premise>I return to it permanently</premise>. <claim>I might as well have never lived</claim>. 

To anticipate a few responses:

  (1) <claim>Helping others doesn't matter</claim>. <premise>They will die too</premise>. <premise>And then their descendants will die, on and on and on</premise>, until <premise>eventually the universe is destroyed or our galaxy collapses in an inevitable heat-death</premise>. <premise>Even if 1,000,000 people were helped by me</premise>, <premise>assuming they all die</premise>, then <claim>my life is still pointless and meaningless</claim>. <premise>For I will be dead and won't know what I did</premise>, and <premise>once they die, they won't know either</premise>. 

  (2) <claim>Attaining fame doesn't matter and doesn't truly make me "immortal."</claim> <premise>I'll be dead</premise>, and again, <premise>death is nothingness</premise>. <premise>Thus, I won't be around to enjoy my fame</premise>. 

  (3) <premise>Enjoying the moment is possible</premise>, but <claim>doesn't make life have a point</claim>. For <premise>once I die, all memories and all point is gone</premise>. 

Please change my view from this depressing sentiment.

  <premise>You make your own purpose in life</premise>. <claim>The only way your life lacks meaning is if you give it none to begin with</claim>.

I would question why you feel that an action's effects have to be felt in perpetuity and never cease in order to be considered "meaningful" to oneself?

  Because <premise>once you die, it is as if none of it ever happened</premise>. <premise>None of it</premise>. 

  <claim>So to YOU, there is, then, no meaning</claim>.
