*Note: Please assume that there is no afterlife when responding to my post. I am not religious. Thank you. ALSO: By "meaningless," I mean "meaningless" to the person who is doing the dying. To the person who is alive and who will then die, life is meaningless. 

  CMV. Assuming <premise>there is no afterlife</premise>, <claim>life is ultimately meaningless and pointless</claim> because <premise>we die<premise>. <claim>Death is the great eraser</claim>. <premise>Living life is as irrational as reading a book that, after finished, is immediately erased from your memory</premise>. <premise>It is comparable to that, too</premise>. 

  <claim>It makes no difference if I, a 23 year old, die now or live until I am 100 and die</claim>. <premise>Either way, after my brief spark of existence I become nothingness</premise>. Not only do <premise>I remember nothing</premise>; <premise>I AM nothing</premise>. <premise>To me, it is as if my life had never happened</premise>. 

I'll put it another way. <premise>Imagine the time before you were born</premise>. Have you remembered it yet? <premise>Of course not</premise>. <premise>You didn't exist</premise>. <premise>This is the state that we return to after death--a state of nothingness similar to the state we were in before birth</premise>. <premise>When I die, I return to this state after a brief period of consciousness</premise>, and <premise>I return to it permanently</premise>. <claim>I might as well have never lived</claim>. 

To anticipate a few responses:

  (1) <claim>Helping others doesn't matter</claim>. <premise>They will die too</premise>. <premise>And then their descendants will die, on and on and on</premise>, until <premise>eventually the universe is destroyed or our galaxy collapses in an inevitable heat-death</premise>. <premise>Even if 1,000,000 people were helped by me</premise>, <premise>assuming they all die</premise>, <claim>then my life is still pointless and meaningless</claim>. For <premise>I will be dead and won't know what I did</premise>, and <premise>once they die, they won't know either</premise>. 

  (2) <claim>Attaining fame doesn't matter and doesn't truly make me "immortal."</claim> <premise>I'll be dead</premise>, and again, <premise>death is nothingness</premise>. Thus, <premise>I won't be around to enjoy my fame</premise>. 

  (3) <claim>Enjoying the moment is possible</claim>, but <claim>doesn't make life have a point</claim>. For <premise>once I die, all memories and all point is gone</premise>. 

Please change my view from this depressing sentiment.

What if time itself is an illusion, and we really do live forever?

<premise>Consider a novel</premise>. <premise>As you read through the novel, you go from page to page, eventually reaching the end</premise>. But does the novel stop existing just because you finished the book? Or does the book continue to exist, with it's words, chapters, stories, characters, and lives intact?

<premise>"Now" is *the page you are reading at this moment*</premise>. But <claim>just because there are pages you've already read, or pages you have yet to read, doesn't mean those pages don't exist</claim>. <premise>And all those pages will continue to exist, even after you've finished your book</premise>.

Most interesting point so far. Thank you!

  And <claim>this view is supported by physics and what we know of it</claim>. <premise>Time isn't "real" in the same sense that we experience it</premise>. <premise>We are simply at one point along a path, and that's the "now"</premise>. <premise>All the other points in time exist as much as the current point in time, however</premise>.

<premise>Let's say I travel from home to the grocery store</premise>: <premise>I leave my apartment, go down the elevator, out on the street, past the cigar shop, past the empty parking lot, and finally to the store</premise>. *Now* I'm at the store, but did my apartment, my elevator, the street I walked on, the cigar shop, and the empty parking lot cease to exist simply because I'm not there *right now*? <premise>Of course not</premise>.
